<!-- ##### VARIABLE libxfce4ui_major_version ##### -->
<para>
The major version number of the Libxfce4ui library (e.g. in version
1.2.3 this is 1).
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the Libxfce4ui library
you have linked against. Contrast with the #LIBXFCE4UI_MAJOR_VERSION
macro, which represents the major version of the Libxfce4ui headers
you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE libxfce4ui_minor_version ##### -->
<para>
The minor version number of the Libxfce4ui library (e.g. in version
1.2.3 this is 2).
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the Libxfce4ui library
you have linked against. Contrast with the #LIBXFCE4UI_MINOR_VERSION
macro, which represents the minor version of the Libxfce4ui headers
you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE libxfce4ui_micro_version ##### -->
<para>
The micro version number of the Libxfce4ui library (e.g. in version
1.2.3 this is 3).
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the Libxfce4ui library
you have linked against. Contrast with the #LIBXFCE4UI_MICRO_VERSION
macro, which represents the micro version of the Libxfce4ui headers
you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### MACRO LIBXFCE4UI_MAJOR_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #libxfce4ui_major_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO LIBXFCE4UI_MINOR_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #libxfce4ui_minor_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO LIBXFCE4UI_MICRO_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #libxfce4ui_micro_version, but from the headers used at
application compile time, rather than from the library linked against
at application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO LIBXFCE4UI_CHECK_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Returns %TRUE if the version of the Libxfce4ui header files is the same
as or newer than the passed-in version.
</para>

@major: major version (e.g. 1 for version 1.2.3)
