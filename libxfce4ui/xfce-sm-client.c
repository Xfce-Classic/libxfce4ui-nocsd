     *     a) Local (or Both) save and we're not shutting down.  We
     *        ignore the Global part of the Both save since prompting
     *        to save files when not shutting down is stupid.
     *     b) Local (or Both) save and we *are* shutting down, but
     *        aren't allowed to interact.  Here a save-state is just
     *        the best we can do.  We ignore the Global part of a
     *        Both save because it's unlikely we can (or should) save
     *        without user interaction.
     * 3.  Emit quit-requested if:
     *     a) Global save, we're shutting down, and we're allowed to
     *        interact.
     * 4.  Emit quit-requested followed by save-state if:
     *     a) Local or Both save, we're shutting down, and we're
     *        allowed to interact.  If it's a Local save, we promote
     *        it to a Both save since shutting down without asking
     *        the user to save their work when it's allowed is rude.
